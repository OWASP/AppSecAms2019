  name: Mario Heiderich
  title: Founder, Cure 53
  bio: <p>Dr.-Ing. Mario Heiderich, aging but still somewhat handsome heart-breaker, ex-security researcher 
       and now a more or less overpaid secretary is from Berlin, still likes everything between lesser- and 
       greater-than, also fine-food and wine-parings and leads a small yet exquisite pen-test company. He 
       frequently pesters peaceful attendees on various conferences with PowerPoint-slides and a very 
       immature sense of humor. Since he doesn't do any research any longer, he really has no actual talk 
       material left, hence finds himself pushed into the shadiest of corners, the keynote corner. People 
       often laugh during his presentations and he assumes it's about his jokes. He could not be more wrong 
       with his assessment.</p>
