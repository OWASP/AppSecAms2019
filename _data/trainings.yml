      - title: Seth and Ken's Excellent Adventures in Secure Code Review
        days: September 23 to September 25
        description: 'Have you ever been tasked with reviewing 3.2 million lines of code manually for SQL Injection, XSS, and Access Control 
                      flaws? Have you been asked to review a new framework on short notice? Does the idea of reviewing Ruby, Go, or Node code 
                      leave you with heartburn? This course addresses all of these common challenges in modern code review. We have 
                      concentrated on taking our past adventures in code review, the lessons we’ve learned along the way, and made them 
                      applicable for others who perform code reviews. We will share our methodology to perform analysis of any source code and 
                      suss out security flaws, no matter the size of the code base, or the framework, or the language. You as a student will 
                      learn the methodology, techniques, approach, and tools used by Seth Law and Ken Johnson to understand code flows, trace 
                      user input, identify vulnerabilities, and effectively secure an application codebase.<br/>
                      <strong>Upon completion, attendees will know:</strong><br/>
                      Students will take away knowledge and experience in approaching numerous code languages and frameworks to complete a 
                      security source code review. In addition, the learned methodology can be customized by the attendee to fit into any 
                      organization’s security SDLC. Finally, the attendee will have the tools to review source code for any web, mobile, or 
                      modern application, whether or not the targeted language is specifically covered during the course'

        description: '"A phased approach to continuous delivery is not only preferable, but it’s also infinitely more manageable".<br/>
                      This quote by Maurice Kherlakian refers to DevOps, a movement that has seeped into organizations across the globe, 
                      resulting in Continuous delivery of apps. However, security remains a serious bottleneck for DevOps. Organizations 
                      struggle with including security in continuous delivery processes.<br/>
                      This training is a comprehensive, focused and practical approach at implementing Security for your Continuous Delivery 
                      Pipeline. The training is backed by a ton of hands-on labs, original research and real-world implementations of DevSecOps 
                      that work.<br/>
                      The training starts with Application Security Automation for SAST, DAST, SCA, IAST, and RASP, apart from Vulnerability 
                      Management and Correlation. Finally, the training closes with a deep-dive of Container Security and Kubernetes, with 
                      detailed perspectives of implementing scalable security for these deployments.'

      - title: Hands-on Threat Modeling and Tooling for DevSecOps
        days: September 24 to September 25
        description: 'This action-packed two-day threat modeling course is designed specifically to help DevOps engineers improve the reliability and 
                      security of delivered software. Sebastien Deleersnyder teaches an iterative and incremental threat modeling method that is 
                      integrated with the development and deployment pipeline.<br/>
                      Speed of delivery is crucial with shorter development cycles, increased deployment frequency, and more dependable releases, and 
                      Sebastien focuses on a risk-based unified threat modeling practice that is in close alignment with business objectives. You’ll 
                      explore tools and learn how to use threat modeling as code to integrate threat modeling in the CI/CD pipeline; you’ll also discover 
                      how to threat model the CI/CD pipeline itself.<br/>
                      Sebastien bases the training material and hands-on workshops on real live use cases in his experience. You’ll be challenged to 
                      perform practical threat modeling in squads of three to four people, covering the different stages of threat modeling on an 
                      incremental business-driven CI/CD scenario:<br/>

        days: September 24 to September 25
        description: 'This 2 day attack-focused, hands-on training will set you on the path to using common attack techniques against docker, kubernetes, 
                      containerized infrastructure. It will help you to learn the approach to follow and the process for testing and auditing containers 
                      and Kubernetes clusters. By the end of the training, participants will able to identify and exploit applications running on 
                      containers inside Kubernetes clusters with a hands-on approach.<br/>
                      An organization using micro services or any other distributed architecture rely heavily on containers and container orchestration 
                      engines like Kubernetes and as such its infrastructure security is paramount to its business operations. This course will set the 
                      base for security testers and DevOps teams to test for common security vulnerabilities and configuration weaknesses across 
                      containerized environments and distributed systems. It also helps to understand the approach and process to audit the Kubernetes 
                      environment for security posture.<br/>

      - title: Your Dynamic Software Security Journey with OWASP SAMM2
        days: September 25
        description: "OWASP SAMM2 (https://owaspsamm.org) is the prime maturity model for software assurance that provides an effective and measurable way for 
                      all types of organizations to analyse and improve their software security posture. Building security into the software development and 
                      management practices of a company can be a daunting task. There are many elements to the equation: company structure, different 
                      stakeholders, technology stacks, tools and processes, and so forth. Implementing software assurance will have a significant impact on the 
                      organisation. Yet, trying to achieve this without a good framework is most likely leading to just marginal and unsustainable improvements. 
                      OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) gives you a structural and measurable framework to do just that. It enables you to 
                      formulate and implement a strategy for software.<br/>
                      The goal of this one-day training, which is a mix of training and workshop, is for the participants to get a more in-depth view on and 
                      practical implementation of the SAMM2 model. The training has run successfully for several years now.<br/>
                      The training is setup in three different parts.<br/>
                      In the first part, an overview is presented of the SAMM2 model and similarities and differences with other similar models are explained. 
                      The different domains (governance, design, implementation, verification, and operations), their activities and relations are explained. 
                      This will incorporate the updates of the v2 of the model. Furthermore, different elements (e.g., metrics) are discussed and the overall 
                      usage scenarios of the model are explained.<br/>
                      The first half-day will be spent on performing an actual SAMM2 evaluation of your own organization (or one that you have worked for). We 
                      will go through an evaluation of all the SAMM domains and discuss the results in the group. This will give all participants a good 
                      indication of the organization's maturity wrt. software assurance. In the same effort, we will define a target maturity for your 
                      organization and identify the most important challenges in getting there. All of this will be executed using the new SAMM2 toolbox.<br/>
                      The final part of the training will be dedicated to specific questions or challenges that you are facing wrt. secure development in your 
                      organization. For instance, what about agile development, DevSecOps, outsourcing, or how do you best organize test automation? In this 
                      group discussion, experience between the different participants will be shared to address these questions.<br/>
                      In case you haven't started a secure software initiative in your organization yet, this training should provide you with the necessary 
                      foundations and ideas to do so. Be prepared for the highly effective and applicable treatment of this large domain! And in case you would 
                      be concerned about confidentiality issues, we adhere to the Chatham House Rule."
