Interested in speaking or providing training at Global AppSec Amsterdam? The OWASP Foundation and its volunteers use a Call for Presentors and Call for Trainers process to select and develop a great program for our attendees. The process is relatively simple and the Event Committee will review applications as they are submitted. The current timeline for the event is:

* Call for Presentations/Trainers opens - TBA
* Review committee announced - TBA
* CfP Closes - TBA
* Notification of submitters - TBA
* Program announced - TBA

## Apply to present at Global AppSec Amsterdam
* [Call for Trainers](missing)
* [Call for Presenters](TBA)

Trainers who are selected receive a revenue share for the classes they teach. The OWASP Foundation **does not** compensate or pay speakers for their service. Additionally the OWASP Foundation **does not reimburse any expenses** for trainers of speakers. Once speakers are selected, they will be required to execute the OWASP Speakers Agreement which can be reviewed [here](https://owasp.wufoo.com/forms/owasp-foundation-speaker-agreement/).
