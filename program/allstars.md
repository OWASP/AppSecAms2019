## Welcome again!

After our usual two years break, we are happy to bring back the awesomeness and present another edition of Allstars. This time taking place in the beautiful town of Amsterdam, alongside the OWASP Global AppSec Amsterdam conference. Allstars 2019 will happen on **26th of September 2019** and take an entire day from morning to evening.

## What is all this?

Allstars 2019 is delivering in one full day what’s known to be the finest, hand-selected talks from prolific speakers and top-tier researchers in the field of information-security.

You can think of Allstars 2019 as a conference inside a conference - offering you one day with the most interesting influencers in today’s web application & general IT (in-)security. Allstars 2019 is a dedicated invited-speakers track at the OWASP Global AppSec Amsterdam conference.

Allstars 2019 itself is free. You only need to have a ticket for the OWASP conference to get in.

We recommend all attendees to have a really good breakfast on 26th. Don’t “allstar” on an empty belly.
